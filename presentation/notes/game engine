Game engines are reusable components developers use to build the framework of the game.

This gives them more time to focus on the unique elements like character models, textures, how objects interact, etc.

If everyone made their games from scratch without the help of excellent game engines, games would take longer and be more difficult to make.

Game engines are the way to go to properly develop a game and have full control over it. They do require advanced developers and experience, as they’re highly customizable and the possibilities are endless. However, they save you a lot of time by offering many preset modules, libraries, effects, and tools so that you don’t have to create everything from scratch.

As advanced as they are, it’s fairly easy to pick up knowledge about how to use them over time thanks to extensive documentation, guides, and tutorials available online. However, using a game engine would be a lot harder for a single person to create a decent game on their own, and that’s why it’s probably better suited for teams or large projects.

Below is a comprehensive list of the top game engines in 2017 to choose from based on your needs.

Please note that this is a comparison only for advanced game engines and doesn’t include simple drag and drop game making tools or any other game development tools (graphics, audio, etc.).
